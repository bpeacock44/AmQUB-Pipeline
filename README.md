This pipeline is an attempt to better automate the Borneman Lab's targeted amplicon microbiome analysis pipeline, which uses Qiime2, Usearch, and Blast for taxonomic assignments. (**Am***plicon***Q***iime2***U***search***B**last)
   
Many of the python, perl, and R helper functions that these scripts call were written by Paul Ruegger.

Currently, the pipeline requires a 64-bit license to [Usearch](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/). (32-bit is available for free, but it won't run large datasets.) All other required software is freely available. 

Vsearch integration is planned as well.
